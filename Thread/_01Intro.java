	/*1. IOStreams: also known as input output Streams
	 *            : this means streams of input or output data
	 *            : stream of input data is a sequence of input data, which can be obtained by: typing on keyboard
	 *                                                                                        : external files
	 *                                                                                        : databases
	 *            : when a program is implemented on input streams, it produces output stream
	 *            : stream of output data is a sequence of output data, which is obtain via: console
	 *                                                                                     : output files
	 *                                                                                     : output database
	 *                                                                                     
	 *2. How to read data from these sources?
	 *   We can read data as:
	 *   
	 *   a. 8 bit bytes: Eg- 00000011, 00001111
	 *   b. Characters: ANSI or ASCII or Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-16)
	 *   c. Primitive datatypes: int, boolean, char, String, float, double
	 *   d. We can read objects by 'Deserialization of objects'
	 *  
	 *3.  There are various classes and their subclasses which are used to read and write files in java*/
